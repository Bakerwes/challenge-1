This assignment was the first look at refactoring existing code. There was no additional content to be added. However, the task given was to improve the code as well as its overall functionality.

***

At first glance, I noticed the title within the HTML had a generic name of "Website". I changed this to "Horiseon" to be more descriptive. 

As I was looking over the stucture of the elements within HTML, I noticed a large amount of "div" parental elements. I improved the overall structure of the HTML file by replacing some of these elements with a header, a few sections, and a footer. 

I added alt tags to the images within the HTML to provide a description of the pictures if imagines do not appear on deployment.

I added a reset CSS file for more user accessibility with different browsers.

Lastly, The CSS file was unnecessarily long. Several classes contained the same CSS rules. I managed to reduce the amount of command lines from 198 to 118 by combining these classes into one sequence while upholding the integrity and functionality of the website.
